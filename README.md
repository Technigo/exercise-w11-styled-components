# React Design Replication Exercise with Styled Components

For this week's practice, you will replicate a given design using React and style it using Styled Components. Try to match the design closely using Styled Components for smooth styling.

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server:

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### Looking for some hints?

## Installing styled-components

1.  Installation Command: To add `styled-components` to your project, use one of the following commands:

    - If you're using `npm`:

      bashCopy code

      `npm install styled-components`

    - If you're using `yarn`:

      bashCopy code

      `yarn add styled-components`

2.  Usage in Project: After installation, you can start using it in your React components by importing:

    javascriptCopy code

    `import styled from 'styled-components';`
